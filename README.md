# Docker PHP 8.2 Debian (11.4 bullseye)

This docker image with PHP 8.2 based on Debian Linux. This image contains extensions needed for own projects (amqp, ~~grpc~~, mysql, pgsql, redis, rdkafka).

Requirements for container based on this image:
* The container must be tight and do only one job. For example, run web server by roadrunner, run consuming queue or message broker.
* Inside a container, you shouldn't want to run multiple processes like supervisor, cron, etc.
* The application configuration must be done through the [Docker Environment Variable](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file) or the [sidecar container pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar).
* To apply application configuration changes in a container you must start a new container (with new configurations) and stop the old container (with old configurations).
* Logging inside the container must be output to stderr and stdout.

## Customization

The PHP ini file is located at /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ directory.
You can customize the PHP ini file by adding your own ini file to the directory.

## Xdebug

For enable xdebug  in local development you need to create in your project directory `xdebug.ini` file with content:
```ini
zend_extension=xdebug

[xdebug]
xdebug.mode=develop,debug
xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.log=/tmp/xdebug.log
```

Then, in the php service definition in docker-compose.yml, add the following to the volumes element.
```yaml
- ./xdebug.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini
```
